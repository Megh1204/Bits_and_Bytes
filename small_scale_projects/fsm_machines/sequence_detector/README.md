A sequence detector can be designed using either a Moore or Mealy machine
with or without considering overlapping (4 different combinations).
1. Moore machine with overlap
2. Moore machine without overlap
3. Mealy machine with overlap
4. Mealy machine without overlap

Detailed Steps to write the verilog code for any Finite State Machine: 
--> STEP1 :- Write module definitions (inputs and outputs).
--> STEP2 :- Define the parameters for FSM stste encodings.
--> STEP3 :- Define the current state and the next state variables
--> STEP4 :- Write the sequenctial logic for present state.
--> STEP5 :- Write the combinational logic for next state and output.
